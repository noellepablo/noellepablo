I wanted to share one of my project presentations from the last class of my master's program, Statistical Learning II. This project involved building a decision support tool using [patient record data](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/tab1/) to predict the probability of hospital readmission. I used Shiny to build my decision support tool which featured an XGBoost model that I constructed using the `tidymodels` collection of R packages.
